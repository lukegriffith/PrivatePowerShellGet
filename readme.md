# PowerShellGet Private Repo

I've played with PowerShell on OSX to launch a Docker nuget repo, and configure PowerShell get to pull modules from it.

Using the PackageManager module, and PowerShellGet I'm able to create a nuget package that contains the module and install it to my module path using the native powershell library.
